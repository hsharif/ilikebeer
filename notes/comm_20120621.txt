We started 960, last Friday June 15, 2012 Andrew said 977. Monday & Tuesday 18-19 came up with a compromise of 978

978 is required because can not do a grid on a prime number.

6 columns 161 with 1 pixel gutter on either side.


Benefits Grid Layout - No new template, reusable code, easy maintenance.
