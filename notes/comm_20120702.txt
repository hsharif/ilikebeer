Missing 

Received the style guide, but missing fonts.
We will have to scrap sears
Need different states for recent activity
Notes from Designers on what needs to be changed

Are we getting files that will say 'final' or do we use the lastest of each file.

The big problem is UX never gave numbered which page is which and the files from multiple designers, copy and UX are all named different.

We have not received anything that is approved.
