Communities: Profile Changes Proprosal

Casey,After a week long review of the profile but backend and front end web development we came up with the following changes.The profile Community Activity sub menu structure is based on content types (Q&A, Blog Posts and Buying Guides). While this seems straight forward from our point of view from a users they do not know the difference between a blog post and buying guide. Further confusion can be drawn between a blog post with lots of comments and Q&A. A user of the site is performing actions (Asking Questions, Answering Questions, Commenting, Following content and voting (Likes) on content).  The proposal is switching the sub menu from content types (ECOM6064-Community -Profile_2012-07-09 v12-FINAL_COPY-PAGE-3.pdf) to activitiy based (Proposed Change Screenshot.png).Here are the main concerns with the current Community Activity sub menu structure.Confusion and FrustrationUser needs to understand different content types to find information they performed activtivies on.Finding comments on questions is only viewable after the question has been answered.The content tabs are not in the priority to the user, but instead by the content threadNo clear and direct navigation to comments on a question.TechnologyLonger development time; Communities user actions were designed around user actions not content. Scalability/Maintenance - Writing queries based on content first instead of user action is more complex. This gives us less flexibilty and increased database/server load.Full list of concerns with scenarios see ProfilePostConcerns.xlsRecommendation - see Proposed Change Screenshot.pngLet me know if you would like further explanation or discussion.-- Brendan GualdoniDirector of Web Developmentmobile:  224.565.3078 email: brendanf.gualdoni@searshc.comskype: brendan.gualdoni.sl
